Write the Python package pdf2md2, using uv and setuptools, that:
- provides a CLI script pdf2md2 (so it's usable with uvx)
- uses pandoc via pypandoc_binary (so there are no external dependencies - requirement for uvx)
- has a CLI arg for the style "-s"/"--style", "water" by default
  - includes a bunch of common CSS stylesheets in the package by default (decide upon a wide selection - like really way too many to be reasonable - and use curl to download them to a separate dir)
- the style arg should work as follows:
  - if it's an URL, download the style to a cache dir in the package install dir and use that
  - elif it's a valid path, use the local file
  - elif it's a file in the package download cache (as "{style}" or "{style}.css"), use that
  - elif it's a file in the package included styles (as "{style}" or "{style}.css"), use that
- has a CLI arg "--no-cache"
- has other appropriate CLI args
- takes a (markdown) file as a positional argument
- outputs a PDF file in the same directory by default, with the same name (only changed extension)
- has a CLI arg "-o"/"--output" to override the output path
- has a CLI arg "--stdout" to write to stdout instead of a file
- provides a script `pdf2md2-clear-cache` to clear the download cache
